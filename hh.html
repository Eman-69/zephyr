            <h2>ABOUT :</h2>
            <p>The Hobart Hurricanes are an Australian professional men's T20 franchise cricket team based in Tasmania, Australia. They compete in Australia's domestic T20 cricket competition known as the Big Bash League, which is a league where many international players compete. Their team represents Hobart. The Hurricanes play the majority of their home matches at Blundstone Arena, with additional home matches at the University of Tasmania Stadium in Launceston. The Hurricanes wear a purple cricket uniform.</p> <p><br></p>
            <p>Some of the best players to represent the Hurricanes since their inception into the BBL have been: D'Arcy Short, Matthew Wade, Tim Paine, Ben McDermott, George Bailey, Dan Christian, Jofra Archer who was the X-factor in the Hurricanes team in BBL07, he bowled at a rapid pace, he was a genuine wicket-taker and had great accuracy regarding his variations. An aggressive lower-order batsman, Archer was a class above his teammates in the Hobart side. He played a crucial role in Hurricanes making the BBL07 final. Naved-ul-Hasan the Pakistani medium-pacer only played in BBL01, but he made a great impact in that season. His medium-pacers brought wickets in the middle and death overs, and he had an unplayable slower ball. Xavier Doherty, Riley Meredith, and Ben Hilfenhaus as a T20 bowler was very effective. Swinging the new ball, he’d give Hurricanes breakthroughs in the power play overs and nail his yorkers at the death. His BBL form for the Hurricanes saw him get an IPL gig with the Chennai Super Kings and a recall to the Australian T20 side in 2012.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY :</h2>
                <p>The Hobart Hurricanes made a bright start to the inaugural Big Bash League season in 2011/12, winning their first game at the WACA Ground against the Perth Scorchers, making 140 before bowling out the Scorchers for 109, with the performance of fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus resulting in his selection for the annual Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the Hurricanes' second match they faced fancied favorites Sydney Sixers before inflicting a 42-run defeat on the Sixers at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. Rana Naved-ul-hasan was the leading wicket taker in Big Bash League 2011–12, taking 15 wickets for the Hurricanes.</p> <p><br></p>
                <p>The Hurricanes played a total of 8 games in the 2012–13 Big Bash League. They ended up losing 4 and winning the same number of games. They finished the tournament in 6th position out of 8 teams. The Hurricanes qualified for the semi-finals in 2013–14 Big Bash by just 1 point ahead of Brisbane Heat. They won the semi-final against the Stars. They were outclassed by Perth Scorchers in the final by 39 runs. They finished as the runners-up, their best position so far. Ben Dunk was named the Man of the Tournament with 395 runs and Jonathan Wells was the young gun of the tournament. They only won 3 games in the 2014–15 season and ended up 5th on the table.
                    In July 2018, they were one of the six teams invited to play in the first edition of the Abu Dhabi T20 Trophy, scheduled to start in October 2018.</p>
