            <h2>ABOUT :</h2>
            <p>The Adelaide Strikers were formed in 2011, as a result of the formation of the Big Bash League. When the competition was first formed, each team had an opportunity to sign up players and build their lists. The contracting window opened on 30 June 2011 at 9 am and closed on 22 July 2011.</p> <p><br></p>
            <p>The Adelaide Strikers are an Australian professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team based in Adelaide, South Australia that compete in the Big Bash League (BBL). Their home ground is the Adelaide Oval, and they play in a cornflower blue uniform. The Strikers were formed in 2011 to play in the BBL, succeeding the Southern Redbacks, who played in the now-defunct KFC Twenty20 Big Bash competition. Their sole victory in the BBL came in 2017â€“18.</p> <br> <br>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Over their 11-year history in the BBL, they have had many effective and popular players on their team, from all-rounders such as Johan Botha, Michael Neser, Kieron Pollard, Ryan ten Doeschate and Chris Jordan, to high-scoring batsmen Travis Head, Colin Ingram, Mahela Jayawardene, Jonathan Wells, Michael Klinger and Jake Weatherald, to effective bowlers Ben Laughlin, Billy Stanlake, Rashid Khan, Peter Siddle, Adil Rashid and Kane Richardson, and finally keepers Alex Carey and Tim Ludeman.</p>
            <!-- <p>The Strikers are currently coached by former Australian cricketer Jason Gillespie and captained by Head. Carey is the current vice-captain.</p> -->

                <p>The Adelaide Strikers were formed in 2011, as a result of the formation of the Big Bash League. When the competition was first formed, each team had an opportunity to sign up players and build their lists. The contracting window opened on 30 June 2011 at 9 am and closed on 22 July 2011. Each team was allowed to sign up to 18 players, including up to two from overseas. The team's inaugural captain was South Australia captain, Michael Klinger, and the inaugural coach was Darren Berry, the then coach of the Southern Redbacks.</p> <p><br></p>

                    Adelaide strikers finish at the top of the table at the end of the league stage.
                    Adelaide Strikers come very close to winning but the title remains elusive and they finish 3rd.

                    Change of leadership as Brad Hodge takes on charge.
                    Adelaide Strikers finish at the top of the table in league stage for the second consecutive time.
                    The results are exactly the duplicate of the last season as Adelaide Strikers finish 3rd again, for the second consecutive time.
                    
                    
                    2016-17
                    
                    
                    A disappointing year for the Adelaide Strikers as they finish 6th.
                    
                    2017-18

                    The 2018-19 was extremely disappointing for the Strikers as they failed to qualify after finishing 7th on the table after the league stage.
                    
                    
                    2019-20
