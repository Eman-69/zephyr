            <h2>ABOUT :</h2>
            <p>The Sydney Sixers are an Australian professional franchise men's cricket team, competing in Australia's domestic Twenty20 cricket competition, the Big Bash League (BBL). Along with the Sydney Thunder, the Sixers are the successors of the New South Wales Blues who played in the now-defunct KFC Twenty20 Big Bash.</p> <p><br></p>
            <p> The Sixers play at Sydney Cricket Ground in the south-eastern area of the inner city while the Thunder play out of Sydney Showground Stadium further west. The inaugural coach was Trevor Bayliss, who was replaced in 2015 by current coach Greg Shipperd. The Sixers' inaugural captain was Australian wicket-keeper Brad Haddin. Both Steve Smith and Moises Henriques have also spent time captaining the team.</p>
            <p>Competing in the inaugural Big Bash League, the Sydney Sixers went on to win the tournament. After finishing third in the regular season games, the Sixers defeated the Hobart Hurricanes in the semi-final at Bellerive Oval. This facilitated a show-down with the Perth Scorchers in the final. They defeated the Scorchers on 28 January 2012, at the WACA Ground, thus becoming the inaugural champions of the Big Bash League. Their second championship came in the ninth BBL season in 2019–20, and was followed by another title in the 2020–2021 season, making the Sixers the current BBL Champions and the equal most successful BBL franchise, tied for three championships with the Perth Scorchers.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY :</h2>
                <p>The Sydney Sixers were created when the decision was made to move away from state representative teams to city-based teams for the domestic Twenty20 competition. It is believed that this move was to align its structure with that of India and South Africa, where their domestic teams are based around cities. This was an important factor for the ongoing Champions League Twenty20 tournament, where those three nations were founding members. It was decided that there would be two teams from Sydney, two teams from Melbourne, and one from each other capital city for an eight team competition. The names Sixers (and Thunder for cross-city rivals) were decided upon by Cricket NSW. Other names considered for the two teams were Rocks and Edge</p> <p><br></p>
