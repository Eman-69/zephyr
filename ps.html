            <h2>ABOUT :</h2>

These wins came against the Hobart Hurricanes and the Sydney Sixers in a last-ball thriller at Canberra's Manuka Oval.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY :</h2>
                <p>The majority of the initial Scorchers squad was recruited from the Western Australia cricket team, with the addition of West Australian Simon Katich and international imports South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs and England's Paul Collingwood. Brad Hogg was recruited despite having not played state or international cricket since the 2007–08 season.</p> <p><br></p>
                <p>The Scorchers started the 2011–12 Big Bash League season poorly, losing to the Hobart Hurricanes in their opening game at the WACA Ground by 31 runs. However, they subsequently won 5 games in a row, finishing the season at the top of the ladder and securing a home final. The Scorchers then won the semi-final against the Melbourne Stars by 11 runs but lost to the Sydney Sixers in the final by 7 wickets.</p>
                <p>By finishing in the top two of the Big Bash League, they won a position at the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 tournament, held in South Africa in October 2012. The team performed poorly, only winning one game. The Marsh brothers, Shaun and Mitchell were both dropped from the final game after excessively celebrating Mitchell's 21st birthday during the tournament.</p>
