			<p>BBL games are currently broadcast in Australia on free-to-air television by the Seven Network and subscription television by Fox Cricket. The Seven Network broadcasts 45 of 61 Matches including the Finals Series. Fox Cricket televises all 61 Matches including 16 Matches exclusively in 4K. The rights were previously held by Network 10, who in 2013 paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel's first foray in elite cricket coverage. Network 10's BBL coverage became a regular feature of Australian summers and attracted an average audience of more than 943,000 people nationally in 2014â€“15 season, including a peak audience of 1.9 million viewers for the final between the Scorchers and Sixers.</p>

				<div class="abouthistorytitle"><h2>About BBL</h2></div><div class="aboutdiv" id="aboutdivid"><p>The Big Bash League (known as the KFC Big Bash League for sponsorship reasons, often abbreviated to BBL or Big Bash) is an Australian professional franchise Twenty20 cricket league, which was established in 2011 by Cricket Australia. The Big Bash League replaced the previous competition, the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, and features eight city-based franchises instead of the six state teams which had participated previously. The competition has been sponsored by fast food-chicken outlet KFC since its inception. It is one of the two T20 cricket leagues, alongside the Indian Premier League, to feature amongst the top ten domestic sport leagues in average attendance.</p><img src="img/about.jpg"></div>
				<div class="abouthistorytitle"><h2>History</h2></div><div class="historydiv" id="historydivid"><img src="img/history.jpg"><p>Big Bash League was established in 2011 by Cricket Australia and is the professional Twenty20 cricket league of Australia. The Big Bash Bash was started as a replacement to the Twenty20 Big Bash, which took place from 2005-6 to 2011-12. It had been proposed that the tournament would undergo expansion into more regional areas not supported by international cricket. The expansion was originally planned to be implemented in 2012. The proposed teams included: Newcastle, Canberra, Geelong, and Gold Coast. A New Zealand-based team was also mentioned as a possibility which would be based at Auckland or Christchurch, but this is unlikely to happen. The expansion proposal was suspended, mainly because the proposed cities lacked the proper cricket hosting facilities. </p></div>
